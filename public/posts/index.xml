      <description>Introduction Recently I bought a TP Link USB adapter, TL-WN725N which is based around the RTL8188EU network device. I wanted to enable Wifi on my laptop where the wifi card was not supported under FreeBSD. What follows are the steps I took to enable it on my laptop (an old Dell Inspiron 3000).
I wrote this handy guide mainly for my future self, knowing that at some point in the future I&amp;rsquo;ll be scratching my head trying to figure out how do I get the WiFi working on a BSD box again!</description>
