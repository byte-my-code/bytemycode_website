      <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Recently I bought a TP Link USB adapter, TL-WN725N which is based around the RTL8188EU network
device. I wanted to enable Wifi on my laptop where the wifi card was not supported under
FreeBSD. What follows are the steps I took to enable it on my laptop (an old Dell Inspiron 3000).</p>
<p>I wrote this handy guide mainly for my future self, knowing that at some point in the future I&rsquo;ll be
scratching my head trying to figure out how do I get the WiFi working on a BSD box again!</p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>This guide is written for the <code>rtwn</code> driver for the RealTec RTL8188E(U) card and similar, and
is being installed on a system with FreBSD-13.2-RELEASE, with all patches and updates applied.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ll be editing system files, remeber to either login as root or prepend the commands with
either <code>doas</code> or <code>sudo</code> depending on which is installed on your system.</p>
<h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3>
<p>Firsty we need to create the wireless Device by running</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>ifconfig wlan create wlandev rtwn0
</code></pre><p>Then add the following code to <code>/etc/rc.conf</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>wlans_rtwn0=&#34;wlan0&#34;
</code></pre><h3 id="step-2">Step 2</h3>
<p>Next we need to add the details about the wireless network we want to connect to, to the
<code>/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf</code> file. If it doesn&rsquo;t exist, then create it. Append the following
to the end of the file:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>network={
    ssid=&#34;MYROUTERNAME&#34;         # Replace with your routers SSID
    psk=&#34;VerySeceretPassword&#34;   # Replace with your router WPA key
}
</code></pre><p>Once you&rsquo;ve added this, run the following command to check it&rsquo;s working ok, and that no errors
are reported</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
</code></pre><p>As long as no errors are reported, <code>ctrl-c</code> to break out in the terminal, ready to complete
the setup.</p>
<h3 id="step-3">Step 3</h3>
<p>Now that the WiFi credentials have been saved and no errors have been reported, we need to tell
the system how to connect - in this case, we&rsquo;re using WPA authentication and SYNCDHCP to get
our IP address and DNS server info from the router.
Add the following to your <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> file to persist across reboots:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>ifconfig_wlan0=&#34;WPA SYNCDHCP&#34;
</code></pre><p>Save the file, and then run the following command in the terminal to restart networking. After
this command is run, you should find that your WiFi is connected.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>service netif restart
</code></pre><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Hopefully by following the above steps, you should have a fully working wifi connection on
your box. These instructions can be replicated for other wifi cards by replacing the
<code>rtwn0</code> text where it appears in the code blocks with the name of the driver for the
card you are trying to use (assuming that there is a driver for your card and it is available
for the version of FreeBSD you are using).</p>
